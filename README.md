The IO22D08 is an I/O board for an Arduino Pro Mini; it provides:

- 8 x relay outputs (10A NO/NC outputs) + LED per channel
- 8 x optically isolated inputs
- 4 x pushbuttons
- 4 x 9-segment LED display (88:88), handy for time/state info

This project contains an Arduino library that can be used to interact with the
IO22D08 hardware and an example sketch that exercises the library.
